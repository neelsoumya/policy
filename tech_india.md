# Which emerging technologies should India focus on — a short policy brief

**Executive summary**
India should pursue a targeted, diversified technology strategy that balances near-term economic gains with long-term strategic autonomy and social inclusion. Priority areas should combine India’s existing strengths (large engineering talent pool, expansive digital adoption, strong pharma and space programmes) with global opportunities in climate technologies, AI and semiconductors. Success depends less on picking a single “winner” and more on (a) building resilient supply chains and manufacturing capacity, (b) developing human capital at scale, (c) creating smart regulation and testbeds, and (d) directing public investment to de-risk private capital. Below are priority technology areas, reasons to prioritise them, and practical policy levers.

**Focus:** Next-generation PV manufacturing, low-cost long-duration storage (mechanical, chemical, thermal), grid modernization, electrolyser scale-up for green hydrogen, and integration with industry (steel, fertilisers).

### 1.4 Advanced batteries and materials science

**Why:** Batteries are central to electrification of transport and grid stability. Materials breakthroughs lower costs and improve longevity.
**Focus:** Cell chemistry innovation, recycling and circular supply chains, and local mineral processing (with environmental safeguards).

### 1.5 Biotechnology, vaccine & therapeutics platforms, and agri-bio tech

**Why:** India’s pharmaceutical manufacturing base plus large agricultural sector mean biotech can drive public health and productivity gains.
**Focus:** mRNA and platform technologies, diagnostics, precision fermentation, climate-resilient crops, and bio-manufacturing capacity with strong biosecurity practices.

### 1.6 Climate-smart agriculture, water and waste technologies

**Why:** Food & water security remain national priorities. Productivity gains and resilience are high-impact and equitable.
**Focus:** IoT-based advisory systems, precision irrigation, treated wastewater reuse, low-cost sensors, and scalable waste-to-value processes.

### 1.7 Advanced manufacturing (additive manufacturing, robotics, automation)

**Why:** Raises productivity, enables custom & small-batch manufacturing, and supports export competitiveness.
**Focus:** Low-cost robotics for SMEs, 3D printing in medtech and aerospace, standards for safe factory automation.

### 1.8 Space technologies and Earth observation

**Why:** India’s space programme delivers practical applications (telecoms, remote sensing, navigation) and global reputational advantages.
**Focus:** Small satellite constellations, launch services, downstream analytics for disaster management, agriculture, and urban planning.

### 1.9 Digital financial infrastructure, fintech, and trustworthy identity systems

**Why:** India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and digital ID (Aadhaar) provide unique platforms to innovate inclusive financial products.
**Focus:** Cybersecurity, open banking, digital credit scoring for underserved populations, and regulation to manage systemic risk.

### 1.10 Quantum technologies (strategic, longer-term)

**Why:** High strategic value for communications and sensing; nascent for computing. India should maintain capability rather than aim for immediate dominance.
**Focus:** Quantum-safe cryptography, sensing applications (metrology, minerals), and academic-to-industry translation hubs.

## 2. Cross-cutting priorities and policy levers

### 2.1 Demand-side public procurement and mission programs

Use government procurement to create early markets for tech (e.g., electrified buses, AI in public health). Launch mission-oriented programmes — regional clean-energy clusters, a national semiconductor mission, agri-tech accelerators.

### 2.2 Strategic public R&D funding plus challenge prizes

Fund translational research and shared infrastructure (cleanrooms, high-performance computing, wet labs). Use challenge prizes and milestone grants to focus talent on measurable outcomes.

### 2.3 Regulatory sandboxes and accelerated certification

Enable responsible experimentation in fintech, health AI, autonomous vehicles, and biotech under time-bounded sandboxes with clear safety and exit rules.

### 2.4 Skills and lifelong learning at scale

Invest in vocational retraining, postgraduate fellowships, and industry-linked apprenticeships. Expand digital and data literacy programs in tier-2/3 cities and rural areas to avoid urban concentration.

### 2.5 Public-private partnerships and anchor firms

Leverage large domestic firms and global anchors to co-invest in manufacturing clusters and export corridors. Structure incentives to require technology transfer, local supplier development, and job creation.

### 2.6 Standards, interoperability and data governance

Promote open standards to encourage interoperability (health, finance, energy). Build a privacy-forward data governance regime that enables innovation (data trusts, consent frameworks) while protecting rights.

### 2.7 Regional inclusion and resilience

Distribute investments geographically to create local employment, reduce migration pressure, and ensure technologies meet diverse climatic and social contexts.

### 2.8 Sustainability and circularity by design

Mandate lifecycle assessments for publicly funded projects. Encourage product-as-a-service models, extended producer responsibility, and recycling infrastructure for electronics and batteries.

### 2.9 International collaboration and export orientation

Pursue strategic alliances for supply chains (chips, rare materials), co-funding for large R&D projects, and export pathways for Indian-made tech solutions, especially to Global South markets.
